script that statistically analyzes house prices and features that affects prices using R code language.

I used AMES housing dataset which has been made by Iowa State University here's the link for the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset

This script was for one of my uni course (statistics in engineering) project.
